PART 1 - Global Situation

Create a View called “forestation” by joining all three tables - forest_area, land_area and regions in the workspace.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW forestation as
 SELECT country_code, country_name, r.region, year, round(f.forest_area_sqkm::numeric, 2) as forest_area_sq_km, round(l.total_area_sq_mi::numeric, 2) * 2.59 as total_area_sq_km,
 f.forest_area_sqkm/(l.total_area_sq_mi * 2.59) * 100 as forest_percentage
 , r.income_group
 FROM forest_area f
 	JOIN land_area l
 	USING (country_code, country_name, year)
 	JOIN regions r
 	USING (country_code, country_name);

A - What was the total forest area (in sq km) of the world in 1990? Please keep in mind that you can use the country record denoted as “World" in the region table.

SELECT region, year, forest_area_sq_km
FROM forestation
WHERE region = 'World'
ORDER BY year
LIMIT 1;
Answer = 41282694.9

B - What was the total forest area (in sq km) of the world in 2016? Please keep in mind that you can use the country record in the table is denoted as “World.”

SELECT region, year, forest_area_sq_km
FROM forestation
WHERE region = 'World'
ORDER BY year DESC
LIMIT 1;
Answer = 39958245.9

C - What was the change (in sq km) in the forest area of the world from 1990 to 2016?
WITH t1 as (
	SELECT forest_area_sq_km as forest16
FROM forestation
WHERE region = 'World' and year = 2016
),

t2 as (
	SELECT forest_area_sq_km as forest90
FROM forestation
WHERE region = 'World' and year = 1990
)

SELECT t1.forest16, t2.forest90, (t2.forest90 - t1.forest16) as result
FROM t1, t2

Answer = 1324449

D - What was the percent change in the forest area of the world between 1990 and 2016?

WITH t1 as (
SELECT forest_area_sq_km as forest16
FROM forestation
WHERE region = 'World' and year = 2016
),

t2 as (
SELECT forest_area_sq_km as forest90
FROM forestation
WHERE region = 'World' and year = 1990
)

SELECT (t2.forest90 - t1.forest16) / t2.forest90 * 100 as result
FROM t1, t2

Answer = 3.20824258980244 or 3,20%

E - If you compare the amount of forest area lost between 1990 and 2016, to which country's total area in 2016 is it closest to?

SELECT year, country_name, total_area_sq_km
FROM forestation
WHERE total_area_sq_km <= 1324449 and year = 2016
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 1;

Answer = 
year	country_name	total_area_sq_km
2016	Peru	1279999.9891

-----------------------------------------------------

PART 2 - Regional Outlook

Create a table that shows the Regions and their percent forest area (sum of forest area divided by sum of land area) in 1990 and 2016. (Note that 1 sq mi = 2.59 sq km)

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS regions2;

CREATE VIEW regions2
AS
SELECT r.region,
       l.year,
       SUM(f.forest_area_sqkm) total_forest_area_sq_km,
       SUM(l.total_area_sq_mi*2.59) AS total_area_sq_km,
        (SUM(f.forest_area_sqkm)/SUM(l.total_area_sq_mi*2.59))*100 AS forest_percentage_region
FROM forest_area f
	JOIN land_area l
		ON f.country_code = l.country_code AND f.year = l.year
        JOIN regions r
      		ON l.country_code = r.country_code
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2;

A - What was the percent forest of the entire world in 2016? Which region had the HIGHEST percent forest in 2016, and which had the LOWEST, to 2 decimal places?

	SELECT round(forest_percentage_region::numeric,2) as world_forest_percentage_2016
	FROM regions2
	WHERE region = 'World' and year = 2016
),

t1 as (
	SELECT year, region, MAX(forest_percentage_region) as max_2016
    FROM regions2
    WHERE year = 2016
    GROUP BY 1, 2
  	ORDER BY 3 DESC
  	LIMIT 1
),

	SELECT year, region, MIN(forest_percentage_region) as min_2016
    FROM regions2
    WHERE year = 2016
    GROUP BY 1, 2
  	ORDER BY 3
  	LIMIT 1
)

SELECT t0.world_forest_percentage_2016, t1.region as max_region, round(t1.max_2016::numeric,2) as forest_percentage_max, t2.region as min_region, round(t2.min_2016::numeric,2) as forest_percentage_min
FROM t0, t1, t2

Answer = 
world_forest_percentage_2016	max_region	forest_percentage_max	min_region	forest_percentage_min
31.38	Latin America & Caribbean	46.16	Middle East & North Africa	2.07

t2 as (
	SELECT year, region, MIN(forest_percentage_region) as min_1990
    FROM regions2
    WHERE year = 1990
    GROUP BY 1, 2
  	ORDER BY 3
  	LIMIT 1
)

SELECT t0.world_forest_percentage_1990, t1.region as max_region, round(t1.max_1990::numeric,2) as forest_percentage_max, t2.region as min_region, round(t2.min_1990::numeric,2) as forest_percentage_min
FROM t0, t1, t2

world_forest_percentage_1990	max_region	forest_percentage_max	min_region	forest_percentage_min
32.42	Latin America & Caribbean	51.03	Middle East & North Africa	1.78

C - Based on the table you created, which regions of the world DECREASED in forest area from 1990 to 2016?

WITH regions90 as (
	SELECT * 
  	FROM regions2
  	WHERE year = 1990
),

regions16 as (
	SELECT *
  	FROM regions2
  	WHERE year = 2016
)

SELECT regions90.region, 		 round(regions90.forest_percentage_region::numeric,2) as 	forest_percentage_1990, 	round(regions16.forest_percentage_region::numeric,2) as 	forest_percentage_2016
FROM regions90
JOIN regions16
	ON regions90.region = regions16.region
WHERE regions90.forest_percentage_region > regions16.forest_percentage_region
